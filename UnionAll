select s.* 
from
(select 'EU' as location, * from eusales 
union all
select 'US' as location, * from ussales) s
where s.price > 50.00 
order by s.location desc, s.id;

/* For this challenge you need to create a UNION statement, 
there are two tables ussales and eusales the parent company 
tracks each sale at its respective location in each table, 
you must all filter the sale price so it only returns rows 
with a sale greater than 50.00. You have been tasked with 
combining that data for future analysis. 
Order by location (US before EU), then by id.
